OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) basically a method of gaining information about the target using various websites such as google , facebook , insta , getting source codes of websites through github, if we get a email
in the sourve code checking wether that email is already pwned or not by vising the site: https://haveibeenpwned.com/, sometimes in order to solve their errors user discloses some delicate information on the surface
through Stack overflow.

So we can use all this websites to gain information about the target i.e a company..


**Phising**

Phishing is another excellent method to breach AD. Phishing usually entices users to either provide their credentials on a malicious web page or ask them to run a specific application that would install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in the background. 
This is a prevalent method since the RAT would execute in the user's context, immediately allowing you to impersonate that user's AD account. This is why phishing is such a big topic for both Red and Blue teams.
